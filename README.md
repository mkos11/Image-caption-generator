# Image Caption Generator

Image Captioning is the task of generating textual descriptions of a given image, requiring techniques of Computer vision and Natural language processing.

## Description

It is a popular research area of Artificial Intelligence that deals with image understanding and a language description for that image. Generating well-formed sentences requires both syntactic and semantic understanding of the language. Being able to describe the content of an image using accurately formed sentences is a very challenging task, but it could also have a great impact, by helping visually impaired people better understand the content of images.

To generate a caption, I have combined two models **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **Long short-term memory (LSTM)**

## Dataset Information

Here, I have used [COCO Dataset 2017](https://cocodataset.org/#download) which contains 12 different types of categories and among them it has 80 types of sub-categories. Each sub categories contain list of images and five captions to each image.
